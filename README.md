# AI Master's Portfolio
Welcome to my Artificial Intelligence Portfolio!  
This repository contains projects I completed during my Master's in AI and additional independent work.  

The goal is to showcase practical applications of **Machine Learning**, **Deep Learning**, **NLP**, **Computer Vision**, and **Reinforcement Learning** to demonstrate both academic understanding and real-world implementation skills.

## Machine Learning
- [Regression Models](./Machine_Learning/Regression_Models.ipynb)
- [K-Means Clustering](./Machine_Learning/Clustering_KMeans.ipynb)

## Deep Learning
- [CNN for Image Classification](./Deep_Learning/CNN_Image_Classification.ipynb)
- [RNN for Text Analysis](./Deep_Learning/RNN_Text_Analysis.ipynb)

## NLP
- [Sentiment Analysis](./NLP/Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb)

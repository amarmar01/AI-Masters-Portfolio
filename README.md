# AI Master's Portfolio
Welcome to my Artificial Intelligence Portfolio!  
This repository contains projects I completed during my Master's in AI and additional independent work.  

The goal is to showcase practical applications of **Machine Learning**, **Deep Learning**, **NLP**, **Computer Vision**, and **Reinforcement Learning** to demonstrate both academic understanding and real-world implementation skills.
